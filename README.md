# RESTAPI-TestAutomation

Project structure- 

This framework would be built using Java and JUnit and on top of restAssured.  This is built as a maven project.

Main java folder : 
This would contain all the classes needed to execute, get the response and validate the tests.

Resources folder: this folder would have all the configurations and the data, which would be needed to run the classes. For now the config file consists of the base URL and port number as im currently running this on my local server.

Test folder : this folder contains the test case scenarios for get and post 

Pom.xml : this file contains all the dependencies 

These are the main components of the project hierarchy needed for this project
